## Description
This application is a CMS-style blogger app where users can post and comment each other's posts. It uses express-handlebars, mysql2, sequelize, express-session, and other packages. With mysql2 and sequelize we can follow CRUD operations for models like users, blogs, and comments. Express-session is used to validate and authenticate the user logging in and allowing only that user to view and operate on their dashboard.
